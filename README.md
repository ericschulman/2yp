Code and documentation to develop a dynamic model of oligopoly. The working example will be a repeated Bertrand game. It is well known that this game admits multiple equilibrium in the stage game from the folk theorem.

In static models of oligopoly, it is easy to let idividual unobservables to determine the outcomes of strategic interactions. There is a lot of literature about what to do in this case.

However, it may not be the idividual unobservables that is causing strange interactions to happen. It may be the fact that the repeated interaction is generating complexity. The goal of the project is to focus on the complexity generated by strategic interactions between firms. Prices among all firms are co-determined in a repeated game. Firms have to choose strategies against eachother.
