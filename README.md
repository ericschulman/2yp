The goal of the project study the strategic interactions between firms setting prices and quantitites. In particular, as firms start to consider the history of the game they are playing figuring out what strategies and actions they will choose is more and more complex. I want to understand these interactions and make robust predictions using a structural econometric model.

Right now, I am focusing on writing code and documentation to do CCP estimation for the Freshtman Pakes model of price wars using Arcidiacono Miller. Repeated interaction generate complexity which is captured by Fershtman Pakes model. Solving the model without iterating the value function would make it practical. It is also a good jumping off point for more complex interactions.

I plan to use data from the texas school milk data set for the purposes of estimation. I may include code scrapping amazon and walmarts website down the line as they have been fighting price wars. Anaylzing the volatile price dynamisc between these companies could also be interesting.

The point of this repository is to keep the code organized.

## About the name

This project orignated when I was working for massive dynamics in Princeton, NJ. The problem involved predicting how volume of sales would change in response to volatile price changes involving trade promotions for *coffee creamers*. Working on this problem got me thinking about how to accurately model and predict prices in volatile markets. I believe that economic structure is required to do accurate prediction. There is a branch to the repository with old code that I wrote while there.
